## Assignments

### Monday, December 7, 8am

#### Transcription/analysis no. 5

Transcribe and analyze [this classical piano passage](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cMFFJaFdFbkFNR2s) (must be logged into Google Drive with CU credentials to access audio). Be sure to include all of the following in your transcription/analysis (these will count towards the Aural Skills 3 grade):

- **Score:** A piano staff (treble and bass) with proper key signature, time signature, and accurate notes and rhythms (you can omit trills, mordents, turns, grace notes, and the like)   
- **Harmony:** Roman numerals and figured bass below the staff.  
- **Functions/cadences:** Harmonic functions (T/PD/D) and cadences below the Roman numerals. *There should be one T–(PD)–D–(T) progression per cadence.*  

Along with your score, submit a timeline analysis that includes the following (these will count towards the Theory 3 grade):  

- Subphrases (bi, ci)  
- Phrases (ant, cons, pres, cont, cbi)  
- Theme type (two layers if a compound theme, as noted in *Open Music Theory*)  
- Though not required, it may be helpful to reproduce the cadences on the timeline.

I have made a [video demo](https://vimeo.com/119572881) of my classical transcription process (string quartets, but still mostly applicable).

Notate the transcription in notation software (such as MuseScore, NoteFlight, Finale, Sibelius, StaffPad, or Lilypond). Submit your transcription as two files: the original music notation file and a PDF score (in case we cannot open your original file). Upload these files to the [*Aural Skills 3* D2L site](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/120555) (under "Content" then "Week 15").

Each of the bullet points listed above will be assessed on a three-point scale (same as pop/rock transcriptions). The "aural" and "theory" parts of the assignment each have three categories, total of 9 points each.


### Thursday, December 10, 8am

#### Sonata analysis no. 2

Analyze the sonata structure of the following movements, both of which have *continuous expositions/recapitulations* ([audio here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cbVcwRzFfMGVmOUE) — must be logged into CU Google account to access):

- Haydn, Symphony No. 2, first movement  
- Haydn, Symphony No. 3, first movement  

After listening and studying these movements, make a timeline for each (using Variations Audio Timeline or [paper](http://courses.shaffermusic.com/materials/timeline-blank.pdf)). On the timelines, be sure to label the following:

- Structural points of arrival (medial caesura declined – if present, essential expositional closure, essential sonata closure, crux)  
- Theme-level modules (primary, TR => FS, closing and/or codetta) — ***in both the exposition and the recapitulation***  
- Movement-level modules (exposition, development, recapitulation)  

See the model analyses I provided to you (in our shared folder on Google Drive under ["Sonata Timelines"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cTEcxQ0p4YklyZFU)) — both paper and Variations Audio Timeliner — for examples of what yours should look like. Be sure to include all 14 elements listed above for each piece. Your grade will be simply the percentage of those 28 things accurately labeled on your timelines.

You may use any written/video/audio resources I have provided, but do not consult other people while working on this assessment. (You are, as always, encouraged to review materials not related to this piece with your colleages as you prep for this analysis.)

**Upload your finished timelines (either the .v2t files or PDF/image files of the paper timelines) to the Theory 3 D2L dropbox (under Content >> Week 15).** If you do your timelines in Variations Audio Timeliner, there is no need to upload the audio files, just the .v2t files.


### Finals week

#### Sonata analysis project

##### Option 1

Consult the two timelines uploaded into the class shared folder on Google Drive for [Mozart's "Haffner" symphony.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cSzRkaEdPdlNKR2M) They differ in a number of ways, and there are still other ways to interpret this piece, perhaps by combining features of one timeline with features of the other. 

After considering the interpretive implications of these two timelines, construct your own. It can match one of these completely, incorporate elements of each, or include wholly original interpretations. Decide which of the two timelines you think makes the most musical and/or theoretical sense — or which parts of each should be combined into a single timeline that makes better sense than these two — and reflect that in your timeline. 

Then write a short paper (800 words maximum) or produce a short video (5 minutes maximum). In your paper/video, explain in detail which analysis you think makes more musical sense and why. You are also free to pick and choose elements from each analysis that you prefer.

Since your timeline will include your identification of all musical elements, and since your space for explanation is limited, ***focus your written/video explanation on the elements that are the most complex or ambiguous.*** (Use the two sample timelines as a guide — the places where they differ are the most likely candidates for ambiguity/complexity.)

There is obviously not a single correct answer that your analysis will be graded in light of. Rather, you will be assessed in light of whether or not you demonstrate an ability to interpret this moderately complex piece in light of the following conceptual categories:

- exposition/recapitulation types  
- sonata modules (P, TR, S, C, TR => FS)  
- structural points of arrival (MC, EEC, ESC)  

Each of these areas will be assessed for whether or not you meet the following three objectives:

- Identify and label those features in your timeline accurately and consistently.  
- Identify the complex and/or ambiguous elements in the movement's sonata form.  
- Explain verbally your reason for analyzing the complex/ambiguous elements the way that you did.

For each of the three conceptual categories, you will receive up to 4 points:

- **4 points:** Successfully meet all three objectives.  
- **3 points:** Successfully meet two of the three objectives.  
- **2 points:** Successfully meet one of the three objectives.  
- **1 point:** A complete attempt that does not successfully accomplish any of the objectives.  
- **0 points:** Incomplete or unattempted.

Your grade for the project will be the percentage of the 12 possible total points achieved.

**Upload your finished timelines (either the .v2t files or PDF/image files of the paper timelines) and paper (PDF file) or video to the Theory 3 D2L dropbox (under Content >> Final).** If you do your timelines in Variations Audio Timeliner, there is no need to upload the audio files, just the .v2t files.

##### Option 2

Choose a sonata-form movement by Mozart, Beethoven, or Haydn that you know well but would like to understand more deeply. Without possible timeline guides from me, perform the same analysis as Option 1. Submit following the same procedure.

***If you choose Option 2, you must get your piece approved by me by Friday, December 11, noon.***

#### Sonata reassessments ####

If you were not satisfied with the quality (or grade) of any of your sonata analyses from assignments 1 or 2, you may do the following reassessment assignment:

Study my timeline analyses of these pieces (in Google Drive under ["Handouts and Keys"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cfjkweVA5NkNfdzZ4RXNMNTFybG43SlRPdVVmZThkU0VFZlFVNHpaai1Lak0)). Compare my analyses to the analysis that you submitted, and look at the feedback you received in D2L. Identify one or more concepts (from the list of things that were each assigned grades) that you would like to reassess to bring your grade up to full credit in those areas.

In a single video *of no more than **two** minutes in length* for each sonata assignment, show your analysis and explain either 1) why you're correct and the model analysis is incorrect, or 2) why the model analysis fits better than what you originally analyzed. (You can hold it up to the camera, do a "screencast" if you know how, or you can try to figure out how to include a screenshot in the video; low-tech is totally fine, as long as we can understand you.) 

The goal is to demonstrate that you now understand concepts you were marked down for in the first attempt, so be sure to include specific musical or theoretical details. For example, don't say "what I labeled as a P theme is really a transition"; instead, say "this passage should be a transition because the tutti affirmation increases the energy and the modulating Prinner leads to the secondary key."

***You can make two two-minute videos ― one for the two-part sonata assignment, one for continuous ― not one per movement.*** 

Submit your video to the dropbox in the Theory 3 D2L site.
