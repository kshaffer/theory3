## Assignments

### For Monday, November 2, 8am

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Nov 2 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 11):

- [Chromatically altered subdominant chords](http://openmusictheory.com/alteredSubdominants.html) (Please note that we will not be making use of the *functional bass* notation referenced in this reading, only Roman numerals and general functions. All of the chords in this resource are S — or PD — function.)


#### "Comprovisation" video

Record yourself (audio or video, whichever is most convenient) improvising a sentence melody on your primary instrument (with solfège, if voice) that follows one of the following schema sequences:

- Meyer – 5-phase Prinner  
- Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound HC  
- Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound PAC  
- Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Fa–fi–sol HC  
- Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Simple PAC  

**Be sure to do a *different* sequence of schemas than you did in Comprovisation No. 1.**

Note that these are the five example sentences provided at the end of the OMT resource on [Improvising a sentence with galant schemata.](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) Look to those examples for guidance. Your melodies can be in any key and in any standard meter (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).

Since you are submitting a recording, you are free to prepare your improvisation by practicing different possibilities. To do so, you can play along with the audio excerpts on the [Improvising a sentence](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) resource, all of which are in C major and simple quadruple time. (Thanks to Mark Arnett for making these!) You may also record multiple takes and submit the best one. (Since preparing and making multiple attempts at an improvisation looks a like composition, we’re dubbing this a “comprovisation.”)

These recorded performances will be graded on the same scale as the live improvised performances .(See the [Assessment guide](http://theory3.shaffermusic.com/assessments/) for details.) As you practice, you may want to work your way up the scale, beginning with the simpler D-level or C-level melodies, and then adding embellishments to reach B-level and A-level complexity that makes good musical sense. Aim for A-level, but submit the highest level that you are able to accomplish with musicality.

Submit your “comprovisation” on the Aural Skills 3 D2L site (Content >> Week 11).

#### Transcription/analysis No. 1

Transcribe and analyze [this excerpt from a classical keyboard piece](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cdmVjVjdDQ2t3djA) (must be logged into Google Drive with CU credentials to access audio). Be sure to include all of the following in your transcription/analysis (these will count towards the Aural Skills 3 grade):

- **Score:** A piano staff (treble and bass) with proper key signature, time signature, and accurate notes and rhythms (you can omit trills, mordents, turns, grace notes, and the like)   
- **Harmony:** Roman numerals and figured bass below the staff.  
- **Functions/cadences:** Harmonic functions (T/PD/D) and cadences below the Roman numerals. *There should be one T–(PD)–D–(T) progression per cadence.*  

Along with your score, submit a timeline analysis that includes the following (these will count towards the Theory 3 grade):  

- Subphrases (bi, ci)  
- Phrases (ant, cons, pres, cont, cbi)  
- Theme type (two layers if a compound theme, as noted in *Open Music Theory*)  
- Though not required, it may be helpful to reproduce the cadences on the timeline.

I have made a [video demo](https://vimeo.com/119572881) of my classical transcription process (string quartets, but still mostly applicable).

Notate the transcription in notation software (such as MuseScore, NoteFlight, Finale, Sibelius, StaffPad, or Lilypond). Submit your transcription as two files: the original music notation file and a PDF score (in case we cannot open your original file). Upload these files to the [*Aural Skills 3* D2L site](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/120555) (under "Content" then "Week 11").

Each of the bullet points listed above will be assessed on a three-point scale (same as pop/rock transcriptions). The "aural" and "theory" parts of the assignment each have three categories, total of 9 points each.


### For Tuesday, November 3

***Please bring your instruments to sections.***


### Thursday, October 29, 8am 

#### Classical improvisation exam 1

In a private exam with your section instructor, perform an improvised melody in the form of a sentence that is idiomatic to the classical instrumental style on an instrument (or voice) of choice. You will be given a harmonic progression (1–2 chords per bar) and series of galant schemata to reflect in the melody, similar to the schema chains on which you based your "comprovisations." If you are performing at the keyboard, play the chords in the left hand (block chords are fine) and the melody in the right hand. If singing, sing with solfège. If playing a different instrument, play only the melody.

You will choose the instrument, the key, and the level of difficulty for the melody they improvise. The highest level of difficulty successfully performed during the unit will determine the unit grade for this objective. (See [assessment guide](/assessments/) for grading scheme — again, the same as comprovisations.)

You may bring notes to the exam to remind yourself of the schemas, but no written out melodies. It is best to practice improvizing schema-based sentences from memory, and using notes simply as a backup.

#### Conceptual video reassessments

If you were not satisfied with your grade or your performance on any of your Unit II conceptual videos (Weeks 9 and 10), you may redo and resubmit them. Please follow the same instructions as the original assignments and take the feedback you received into account. (Please note that you can only *re*assess if you submitted an assessment to begin with.) Submit your reassessments to the Conceptual Video Reassessments dropbox on the Theory 3 D2L site (Content >> Week 11).


### For Monday, November 9, 8am

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Nov 9 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 12):

- Reading TBA


#### "Comprovisation" video reassessments

If you were not satisfied with your grade or your performance on either or both of the comprovisation assignments, you may redo and resubmit them. Please follow the same instructions as the original assignments and take the feedback you received into account. (Please note that you can only *re*assess if you submitted an assessment to begin with.) Submit your reassessments to the Comprovisation Reassessments dropbox on the Theory 3 D2L site (Content >> Week 12).

#### Transcription/analysis No. 2

Transcribe and analyze [***excerpt and link forthcoming***]() (must be logged into Google Drive with CU credentials to access audio). Be sure to include all of the following in your transcription/analysis (these will count towards the Aural Skills 3 grade):

- **Score:** A piano staff (treble and bass) with proper key signature, time signature, and accurate notes and rhythms (you can omit trills, mordents, turns, grace notes, and the like)   
- **Harmony:** Roman numerals and figured bass below the staff.  
- **Functions/cadences:** Harmonic functions (T/PD/D) and cadences below the Roman numerals. *There should be one T–(PD)–D–(T) progression per cadence.*  

Along with your score, submit a timeline analysis that includes the following (these will count towards the Theory 3 grade):  

- Subphrases (bi, ci)  
- Phrases (ant, cons, pres, cont, cbi)  
- Theme type (two layers if a compound theme, as noted in *Open Music Theory*)  
- Though not required, it may be helpful to reproduce the cadences on the timeline.
