From the [assessment guide](/assessments/):

> In each unit of study, you will create a portfolio of prepared performance videos. Videos will be submitted in the dropbox of the Aural Skills 3 D2L site, and will count toward the Aural Skills 3 grade. Some videos will be individual, others for a small ensemble.

> Make a video of yourself performing each of the pieces in the portfolio. Each video in the portfolio will be assessed according to a 2-point rubric:

> - 2 points: accurate, concert-ready performance  
- 1 point: an honest attempt, but not yet concert-ready  
- 0 points: no attempt made, or video reflects little-to-no preparation

> Video performances will generally be due early in the unit, submitted by 8am on Mondays. Videos receiving 1 point will be allowed to submit a second video one week after the original due date, in order to re-attempt the full 2 points (accurate, concert-ready performance). Further reassessments *may* be allowed, at the discretion of the Tuesday/Thursday section instructor.

> Details about specific pieces, collaboration options, etc. will be provided as performance videos are assigned.


## Assignment details

Record yourself on video performing excerpts from two songs, "Scar" by Missy Higgins and "Without Me" by Kina Grannis. You will find scores of the excerpts in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cUVc5QWhnZy12b28&usp=sharing) (must be logged in with CU IdentiKey credentials to view the scores). 

*Perform one of these excerpts on an instrument of choice (most likely your primary instrument), and the other excerpt sung with solfège while conducting.* You may choose which excerpt is performed which way.

Please be sure to do the following in your performance video:

- Do not worry about the video recording quality. Any cell phone, laptop, or tablet camera that takes video is fine, as long as we can 1) tell who is performing and 2) distinguish pitch and rhythm accuracy. (If you don't have access to a recording device please talk to Kris and/or your section instructor ASAP so we can work out a reasonable solution.)  
- Listen to recordings of each of these songs (both are on Spotify) to get a good sense of them in your ear.  
- When singing, use solfège proper to the key, and conduct according to the meter. (Note that "Without Me" changes keys in m. 17. Your solfège should change there as well.)  
- Make sure that we can visually identify you in the video. If you can't aim the camera at your face while performing, be sure to pop your head on screen at some point and say "hi" so we know it's you.  
- If possible, frame the video so that we can see your hands when performing at an instrument.  
- Perform ***at the same tempo that the song is commercially recorded.***  
- Perform in any key you like. (Use the MuseScore or MusicXML files — which Finale, Sibelius, and NoteFlight can import — to transpose the excerpt or change clefs, as appropriate.)  
- Before uploading your video, name it "SectionInstructor-YourLastName-SongTitle". For example, if I record a video of "Without Me" and I am in Mark Arnett's section, I'd name my file Arnett-Shaffer-WithoutMe.mov.  
- Be very careful to follow the upload instructions below.

As noted above, only performances that are perfect or nearly so (in pitch and rhythm) will be given full credit. So please take some time to rehearse these excerpts. Record multiple takes if you like, and upload the best one.

As listed on the [assignment schedule](http://theory3.shaffermusic.com/schedule/), please submit your video of one of these excerpts by 8am on **Tuesday, September 8,** and the other by 8am on **Monday, September 14.** You can choose which exerpt to submit on which date. Only videos submitted on time (unless you have permission from your section instructor in advance) will be assessed for credit.

This assignment will count towards the Aural Skills 3 grade.

Reassessments are allowed, but *only for videos that are submitted on-time* (see above).

## Uploading instructions

I'm hoping that OIT will have our D2L site fully functional by Thursday or Friday. Once it is up, I will add full instructions for uploading to the Aural Skills 3 D2L site. If they do not get D2L up in time, we will use Google Drive. Either way, I will provide uploading instructions before the weekend.
