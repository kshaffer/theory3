## Assignments

### For Monday, October 19, 8am

#### Pop/rock analysis project

[Details can be found here.](/popRockProject/)

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Oct 19 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 9):

- [Galant schemata – opens and closes](http://openmusictheory.com/schemataOpensAndCloses)  
- [Galant schemata – summary](http://openmusictheory.com/schemataSummary.html)  
- [Improvising a sentence with galant schemata](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html)  


### For Tuesday, October 20

***Please bring your instruments to sections.***


### For Thursday, October 22, 8am

Make ***two*** conceptual videos. Each video should be no more than 90 seconds long, and should explain one of the core concepts from Week 9 (listed above). See the [Assessment Guide](/assessments/) for details about creating these videos, including examples, before you begin. Remember to include a musical example that was *not covered in class or in the assigned readings.* Submit the videos to the D2L theory site (under "Content" then "Week 9").

Also, take a stab at composing a single presentation phrase that matches the formal characteristics we've explored (tonic prolongation, two melodically related basic ideas) and fits one of the [presentation schemata](http://openmusictheory.com/schemataOpensAndCloses) we've engaged this week. This is not for a grade, but we will be doing an in-class exercise based on them, so please put some thought into them. Upload them (either a PDF/image from your notation software, or a picture of a hand-written score) to the Aural Skills 3 D2L site (Content >> Week 9).

Finally, ***please bring your instruments to sections.***

### For Monday, October 26, 8am

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Oct 26 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 10):

- [Performing a harmonic analysis](http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicAnalysis.html)  
- [Modulation](hhttp://openmusictheory.com/Modulation.html)  

#### "Comprovisation" video

Record yourself (audio or video, whichever is most convenient) improvising a sentence melody on your primary instrument (with solfège, if voice) that follows one of the following schema sequences:

- Meyer – 5-phase Prinner  
- Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound HC  
- Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound PAC  
- Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Fa–fi–sol HC  
- Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Simple PAC  

Note that these are the five example sentences provided at the end of the OMT resource on [Improvising a sentence with galant schemata.](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) Look to those examples for guidance. Your melodies can be in any key and in any standard meter (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).

Since you are submitting a recording, you are free to prepare your improvisation by practicing different possibilities. To do so, you can play along with the audio excerpts on the [Improvising a sentence](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) resource, all of which are in C major and simple quadruple time. (Thanks to Mark Arnett for making these!) You may also record multiple takes and submit the best one. (Since preparing and making multiple attempts at an improvisation looks a like composition, we’re dubbing this a “comprovisation.”)

These recorded performances will be graded on the same scale as the live improvised performances .(See the [Assessment guide](http://theory3.shaffermusic.com/assessments/) for details.) As you practice, you may want to work your way up the scale, beginning with the simpler D-level or C-level melodies, and then adding embellishments to reach B-level and A-level complexity that makes good musical sense. Aim for A-level, but submit the highest level that you are able to accomplish with musicality.

Submit your “comprovisation” on the Aural Skills 3 D2L site (Content >> Week 10).
