## Grades (from the syllabus)

The most important and interesting aspects of learning are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.

My goal in grading is three-fold: to diminish the significance and the negative impact grades can have on the learning environment, to direct your studies clearly (but flexibly) to specific areas that need attention, and to make sure that grades do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

With that in mind, assessment will be oriented around specific concepts and skills, and in order to facilitate learing, the bulk of the assessments will either allow collaboration or reassessment, if not passed on the first attempt. All assessments within a category will be weighted equally.

I have done my best to keep the assessment simple, especially since there will naturally be a little confusion about the way that this combined course will produce separate grades for theory and aural skills. All assignments will be clearly marked as counting towards theory or aural skills, and all of the section instructors, graders, and I will do our best to ensure that the course gradesbooks (in D2L) are continually up-to-date. However, when questions and confusions inevitably arise, it is your responsibility to talk to your section instructor or to me as soon as you can so that we can straighten things out.

### Final grade calculation

Following are assessment types that comprise the final Theory 3 grade:

- **Online quizzes (open-note)** - 15% of the final Theory 3 grade.  
- **In-class quizzes (closed-note)** - 15% of the final Theory 3 grade.  
- **Conceptual videos** - 30% of the final Theory 3 grade.  
- **Conceptual connections** - 10% of the final Theory 3 grade.  
- **Application assignments** - 20% of the final Theory 3 grade.  
- **Synthesis projects** - 10% of the final Theory 3 grade.

Following are assessment types that comprise the final Aural Skills 3 grade:

- **Prepared performance (voice and/or instrument)** - 25% of the final Aural Skills 3 grade.  
- **Live performance (from sight or improvized)** - 25% of the final Aural Skills 3 grade.  
- **Fast transcription (dictation)** - 25% of the final Aural Skills 3 grade.  
- **Slow transcription** - 25% of the final Aural Skills 3 grade.  

Below are written and/or video descriptions of the activities that will be assessed during this course. Where applicable, examples are also provided.

*Some of the assessment practices may be unfamiliar to you. For more information on why I grade the way that I do, please see my blog post, ["Why Grade?"](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/07/why-grade/). I am glad to answer any questions you have (the earlier the better) and to entertain proposals for changes or exceptions (again, the earlier the better).*


## Reading/video quizzes (at-home)

There will be two reading/video assignments most weeks, with online reading quizzes due to be completed by 8am on Monday and Wednesday. These quizzes will run in the D2L site for Theory 3, and will count towards the Theory 3 grade. Only quizzes submitted by students present in class will be assessed.

Online quizzes will be open-note, will include mostly informational questions, and will be graded by percentage of questions answered correctly. Most quizzes will contain one or two questions that are created in order to get you thinking about conceptual issues that we will engage during class, and to give me information about everyone's general level of understanding before class. These questions will receive full credit for any honest attempt, regardless of correctness, and will be labeled as "graded for attempt only."

While these quizzes are open-note and collaboration is allowed, I highly encourage you to attempt them individually without consulting readings or notes, and then go back to your notes (and/or your study partner's notes) and correct any mistakes before submitting your answers. This will give you both practice recalling the information and feedback when you are incorrect — two of the most helpful things for memorizing information correctly (and preparing for in-class quizzes).

## Reading/video quizzes (in-class)

Most class meetings will begin with a short (5 minutes or less) paper-based, closed-note quiz. These quizzes will count towards the Theory 3 grade.

All of the questions on these quizzes will be taken from previous online quizzes, including the online quiz due on that class day. While questions from all quizzes are fair game, most of the questions on these in-class quizzes will be taken from the most recent online quizzes.

The goal for these quizzes is to promote the memorization of basic information that we will be addressing and applying in class, and to promote long-term retention of information engaged in this course. Thus, they must be done regularly and *before* we work through these concepts in class. There are no reassessment opportunities for quizzes. However, the lowest 15% of quiz grades will be dropped when calculating your final grade. 

## Conceptual videos

Each week (beginning with Week 2), you will submit three conceptual videos. These videos will be uploaded to the dropbox on the Theory 3 D2L site by the beginning of your section meeting on Thursday (unless other instructions are provided), and will count towards the Theory 3 grade. They will be graded pass/not-pass, but you will have a reassessment opportunity (see below). There is no collaboration for these videos.

These videos should be *no more than 90 seconds*, and in them you should explain the concept in your own words and present at least one example of application to elucidate that explanation. These examples of application should be pieces of music *not covered in class or in Open Music Theory*. Examples can come from existing pieces in the repertoire, or pieces that you compose yourself.

Videos that explain the concept accurately and coherently with a relevant example will receive credit. Videos submitted by the deadline but not up to standard will be allowed a single reassesment opportunity, due one week after the original deadline. (For most weeks, that means submitting any redos along with the next week's assigned videos.) 

For each concept, one student video will be shared publicly (with that student's permission) with the class on our collaborative concept map. Throughout the course, this map will provide a high-quality set of concise explanations for student review and public consumption.

*Example video(s) forthcoming.*

## Conceptual mapping

Each week (beginning with Week 3), you will submit three explanations of conceptual relationships. These will be uploaded to the Theory 3 D2L site by the beginning of your section meeting on Thursday (unless other instructions are provided), and will count toward the Theory 3 grade. They will be graded pass/non-pass, and there will be no reassessment opportunities. However, you will be allowed to collaborate with one or two other people (be sure to include the name(s) of your collaborator(s) in the text of your submission).

We will collaboratively create a visual diagram that maps out our core concepts and their relationships. This diagram will include each of the core concepts for each unit, with lines drawn between concepts that are related, and a written or verbal explanation of each relationship (between one and three sentences per relationship). I will build one master concept map over the entirety of the course, based on your submissions. Each week you will submit explanations for relationships between concepts from the previous weeks' study. All correct explanations will receive credit, and the best explanation for each relationship will be posted to the collaborative concept map anonymously.

Here is an example collaborative concept map from my online Music Cognition course:

## Application assignments (theory)

Most weeks will involve small-scale assignments in which you will cultivate and/or demonstrate your skills in applying the concepts of the week (and possibly those covered in previous weeks) in a musical task. These will generally be due by 8am on Mondays, and will count toward the Theory 3 grade. Submit via the dropbox on the Theory 3 D2L site, unless given different instructions.

These application assignments will include voice-leading exercises, harmonic reductions, harmonic/melodic/formal analyses, composition exercises, etc. For each assignment type, you will be provided with specific instructions and a model assignment to consult as you work. 

## Synthesis projects 

Each major unit of study will contain an end-of-unit project in which you will demonstrate the ability to synthesize many, if not all, of the concepts covered in that unit in a large(ish)-scale musical project, such as an analytical paper, a full-movement model composition, a research project, etc. Specific details will be provided for each unit. These projects will count toward the Theory 3 grade.

## Prepared performance

In each unit of study, you will create a portfolio of prepared performance videos. Videos will be submitted in the dropbox of the Aural Skills 3 D2L site, and will count toward the Aural Skills 3 grade. Some videos will be individual, others for a small ensemble.

Make a video of yourself performing each of the pieces in the portfolio. Each video in the portfolio will be assessed according to a 2-point rubric:

- 2 points: accurate, concert-ready performance  
- 1 point: an honest attempt, but not yet concert-ready  
- 0 points: no attempt made, or video reflects little-to-no preparation

Video performances will generally be due early in the unit, submitted by 8am on Mondays. Videos receiving 1 point will be allowed to submit a second video one week after the original due date, in order to re-attempt the full 2 points (accurate, concert-ready performance). Further reassessments *may* be allowed, at the discretion of the Tuesday/Thursday section instructor.

Details about specific pieces, collaboration options, etc. will be provided as performance videos are assigned.

## Live performance (from sight or improvized)

This course contains the following three live-performance objectives:

- Sight-read a melody of moderate complexity in a contemporary pop/rock style, at an instrument or voice of choice.  
- Sight-read a melody that follows the formal conventions of classical/*galant* themes, sung with solfege.  
- Improvize a melody that follows the formal conventions of classical/*galant* themes, at an instrument or voice of choice.

These will be assessed via individual in-person exams that will take the place of a Tuesday/Thursday section. They will be graded according to a 3-point rubric (see below), and will count towards the Aural Skills 3 grade. Two exam slots will be reserved for the pop/rock objective, and three exam slots will be reserved for the two classical/*galant* objectives. Students may attempt each objective once or twice. (Additional attempts will only be provided at the discretion of the Tuesday/Thursday section instructor.) Only the best score for each objective will count toward the final grade. 

Grades for each sight-reading exam will be assigned as follows:

- 3 points: a (nearly) flawless performance on the first or second attempt.  
- 2 points: a strong performance with a few small mistakes, or which requires more than two attempts to sound concert-ready.  
- 1 point: an honest attempt, but with significant errors.  
- 0 points: no attempt or performance reflects little-to-no preparation.

Grades for each improvisation exam will be assigned as follows:

- 3 points: a stylistically appropriate performance with 3 or more notes in most stages of the schemas and several diatonic and chromatic embellishing tones, on the first or second attempt.  
- 2 points: a stylistically appropriate performance with 1 or 2 notes in most stages and/or minimal use of embellishing tones, on the first or second attempt.  
- 1 point: an accurate performance of the skeleton notes of the schemata, but little-to-no embellishment, on the first or second attempt.  
- 0 points: no attempt, or inaccuracies on the skeleton notes of the schemas.


## Slow transcription

This semester will contain a number of short, full-textured transcriptions, in both pop/rock and classical (typically keyboard or string-quartet) styles. Slow transcriptions will be submitted via the dropbox on the Aural Skills 3 D2L page and will count toward the Aural Skills 3 grade.

Each transcription will be evaluated for accuracy of four musical features:

- melody (pitch, rhythm, and register)  
- bass line (pitch, rhythm, and register)  
- harmony (lead-sheet chord symbols for pop/rock, Roman numerals and T/S/D labels for classical)  
- inner/other voices (all vocal parts and melodic instruments for pop/rock, all voices/parts for classical)

Each of these features will be given a score on the following 3-point scale (total of 12 points per transcription):

- 3 points: a performance-ready transcription (most professional musicians would not be able to tell that it contained mistakes).  
- 2 points: mostly correct, but with 1–3 mistakes that a professional musician would notice in a performance.  
- 1 point: more than three noticeable mistakes.  
- 0 points: not attempted, or attempt reflects little-to-no substantive effort.

The best three pop/rock transcriptions and the best three classical transcriptions will count towards the final grade.

I have made a [video demo](https://vimeo.com/119572881) of my classical transcription process.


## Fast transcription (dictation)

This semester will also contain a number of short transcription exercises, focusing solely on melodies and bass lines in both pop/rock and classical styles. Assessments will generally take place during the Monday/Wednesday classes and will count toward the Aural Skills 3 grade.

Each fast transcription assignment will contain 2–3 melodies or bass lines, and each melody/bass line will be given a single score on the same 3-point scale as the slow transcriptions. The best two pop/rock transcription assignments and the best two classical transcription assignments will count toward the final grade.
