## Assignments

### For Monday, November 30, 8am

#### Reading

Please read the following:

- [Sonata Theory – exposition types](http://openmusictheory.com/SonataTheory-exposition.html) ("Multiple MCs" and "The continuous exposition")

There will be no quiz for this reading, but we will need these concepts for the work we'll be doing in class on Monday.

#### Transcription/analysis no. 4

Transcribe and analyze [this classical keyboard passage](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/file/d/0B9o4hmKNoi6cS194Mmo0NzhPeWM/view?usp=sharing) (must be logged into Google Drive with CU credentials to access audio). Be sure to include all of the following in your transcription/analysis (these will count towards the Aural Skills 3 grade):

- **Score:** A piano staff (treble and bass) with proper key signature, time signature, and accurate notes and rhythms (you can omit trills, mordents, turns, grace notes, and the like)   
- **Harmony:** Roman numerals and figured bass below the staff.  
- **Functions/cadences:** Harmonic functions (T/PD/D) and cadences below the Roman numerals. *There should be one T–(PD)–D–(T) progression per cadence.*  

Along with your score, submit a timeline analysis that includes the following (these will count towards the Theory 3 grade):  

- Subphrases (bi, ci)  
- Phrases (ant, cons, pres, cont, cbi)  
- Theme type (two layers if a compound theme, as noted in *Open Music Theory*)  
- Though not required, it may be helpful to reproduce the cadences on the timeline.

I have made a [video demo](https://vimeo.com/119572881) of my classical transcription process (string quartets, but still mostly applicable).

Notate the transcription in notation software (such as MuseScore, NoteFlight, Finale, Sibelius, StaffPad, or Lilypond). Submit your transcription as two files: the original music notation file and a PDF score (in case we cannot open your original file). Upload these files to the [*Aural Skills 3* D2L site](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/120555) (under "Content" then "Week 14").

Each of the bullet points listed above will be assessed on a three-point scale (same as pop/rock transcriptions). The "aural" and "theory" parts of the assignment each have three categories, total of 9 points each.


### Thursday, December 3, 8am

#### Sonata analysis no. 1

Analyze the sonata structure of the following movements ([audio here](https://drive.google.com/a/colorado.edu/folderview?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cVzUzUEhfUlFxVzA&usp=sharing) — must be logged into CU Google account to access):

- Beethoven, Piano Sonata in G Minor, Op. 49/1, i.  
- Beethoven, Piano Sonata in G Major, Op. 49/2, i.  

After listening and studying these movements, make a timeline for each (using Variations Audio Timeline or [paper](http://courses.shaffermusic.com/materials/timeline-blank.pdf)). On the timelines, be sure to label the following:

- Structural points of arrival (medial caesura, essential expositional closure, essential sonata closure, crux)  
- Theme-level modules (primary, transition, secondary, closing) — ***in both the exposition and the recapitulation***  
- Movement-level modules (exposition, development, recapitulation)  

See the model analyses I provided to you (in our shared folder on Google Drive under ["Sonata Timelines"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cTEcxQ0p4YklyZFU)) — both paper and Variations Audio Timeliner — for examples of what yours should look like. Be sure to include all 15 elements listed above for each piece. Your grade will be simply the percentage of those 30 things accurately labeled on your timelines.

You may use any written/video/audio resources I have provided, but do not consult other people while working on this assessment. (You are, as always, encouraged to review materials not related to this piece with your colleages as you prep for this analysis.)

**Upload your finished timelines (either the .v2t files or PDF/image files of the paper timelines) to the Theory 3 D2L dropbox (under Content >> Week 14).** If you do your timelines in Variations Audio Timeliner, there is no need to upload the audio files, just the .v2t files.


### Monday, December 7
