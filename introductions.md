<a href="/img/twitterBio.jpg"><img src="/img/twitterBio-small.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 12px" alt="bio picture of Kris Shaffer, Ph.D."/></a>Welcome to the second year of the music theory and aural skills sequence at CU–Boulder! 

This year, we are trying something new for CU. We are combining second-year theory and aural skills courses into a single course. I will teach the two large "lecture" sections on Monday and Wednesday, and Mark Arnett and Elena Specht will teach the smaller "lab" sections on Tuesday and Thursday. Because this is a trial, there are still separate grades for theory and aural skills (explained in the [assessment guide](/assessments/)). However, we will flow more freely between what has traditionally been considered "written" and "aural" concepts, engaging both in any or all of our meetings. We hope that this combination will allow for deeper, more natural musical engagement, and more meaningful, long-lasting musical growth.

In this combined course, we will be pursuing the following goals:

- *fluency* in moderately advanced musical concepts - performing, transcribing, writing, recognizing, and analyzing  
- *connection* of those concepts to music from a multiplicity of styles  
- experience *building* musical structures, such as melodies, phrases, and themes  
- experience *breaking* musical structures apart, and possibly *re-building* them, in order to understand them better  
- the ability to *ask good questions* about musical structure and meaning  
- *critical mindfulness* – which techniques belong to which styles, which methods of building and breaking are appropriate for which pieces of music, etc.

Note that these goals are about *you* and *your* growth as musicians. The work of dead (or living) celebrities like Bach, Beethoven, Beyoncé, and The Beatles is not at the center of what we will do. Nor will our activity as the instructors be at the center of what we do. *Your* work will be at the center of class. We as instructors will design activities to support that work and guide you through it, we will choose (or write) materials to support that work, and we all (students and instructors) will together choose much of the repertoire through which we will work. But it is you and your musical/intellectual/personal growth that will be at the center of what we do.

Of course, there's more than one of you, and we will do much of this work together. In order for that to work, we need to create an environment of mutual respect and inclusion, where we are all safe to try new things and float new ideas, as well as to challenge those ideas. I have done my best to accomodate different personality types, different study preferences, and lots of opportunities to try something out without worrying about a grade penalty in the way that I have designed assessments and class activities. However, creating an environment in which all feel respected, feel free to speak their mind and live their identity, is a responsibility we all must take on — both individually and collectively. Let's all commit to doing what we can to create an inclusive, mutually supportive environment, and please feel free to come to me if you feel that is not happening in the ways that it could (or should).

We will hit the ground running with our work on Day 1 (Monday, August 24). In order to be ready to go, please bring the following to class:

- a pencil (or two)  
- staff paper (please bring this every day)  
- a web-enabled device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc. — these will also be needed every day; please contact me if this is not possible or practical for you, and we can work out another solution)  

I'm personally looking forward to our time together this semester! I'll see you all on Monday morning!
