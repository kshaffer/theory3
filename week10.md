## Assignments

### For Monday, October 26, 8am

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Oct 26 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 10):

- [Performing a harmonic analysis](http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicAnalysis.html)  
- [Modulation](hhttp://openmusictheory.com/Modulation.html)  

#### "Comprovisation" video

Record yourself (audio or video, whichever is most convenient) improvising a sentence melody on your primary instrument (with solfège, if voice) that follows one of the following schema sequences:

- Meyer – 5-phase Prinner  
- Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound HC  
- Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound PAC  
- Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Fa–fi–sol HC  
- Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Simple PAC  

Note that these are the five example sentences provided at the end of the OMT resource on [Improvising a sentence with galant schemata.](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) Look to those examples for guidance. Your melodies can be in any key and in any standard meter (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple).

Since you are submitting a recording, you are free to prepare your improvisation by practicing different possibilities. To do so, you can play along with the audio excerpts on the [Improvising a sentence](http://openmusictheory.com/schemata-improv.html) resource, all of which are in C major and simple quadruple time. (Thanks to Mark Arnett for making these!) You may also record multiple takes and submit the best one. (Since preparing and making multiple attempts at an improvisation looks a like composition, we’re dubbing this a “comprovisation.”)

These recorded performances will be graded on the same scale as the live improvised performances .(See the [Assessment guide](http://theory3.shaffermusic.com/assessments/) for details.) As you practice, you may want to work your way up the scale, beginning with the simpler D-level or C-level melodies, and then adding embellishments to reach B-level and A-level complexity that makes good musical sense. Aim for A-level, but submit the highest level that you are able to accomplish with musicality.

Submit your “comprovisation” on the Aural Skills 3 D2L site (Content >> Week 10).

### For Tuesday, October 27

***Please bring your instruments to sections.***


### For Wednesday, October 28, 8am

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Oct 28 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 10):

- [Hybrid themes](http://openmusictheory.com/hybridThemes.html)  
- [Compound period](http://openmusictheory.com/compoundPeriod.html)  

***The quiz is cancelled, since I did not have time to put it together and give you sufficient time to do it. However, please read the above two pages carefully. We will engage those concepts in Wednesday's class, and they may show up on the transcription/analysis assignment over the weekend.***


### For Thursday, October 29, 8am

Make ***two*** conceptual videos. Each video should be no more than 90 seconds long, and should explain one of the core concepts from Week 10 (listed above). See the [Assessment Guide](/assessments/) for details about creating these videos, including examples, before you begin. Remember to include a musical example that was *not covered in class or in the assigned readings.* Submit the videos to the D2L theory site (under "Content" then "Week 10").


Finally, ***please bring your instruments to sections.***

### For Monday, November 2, 8am

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Nov 2 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 11):

- Readings TBA


#### "Comprovisation" video

Record yourself (audio or video, whichever is most convenient) improvising a sentence melody on your primary instrument (with solfège, if voice) that follows one of the following schema sequences:

- Meyer – 5-phase Prinner  
- Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound HC  
- Jupiter – Passo Indietro – Compound PAC  
- Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Fa–fi–sol HC  
- Sol–fa–mi – Prinner – Simple PAC  

**Be sure to do a *different* sequence of schemas than you did in Comprovisation No. 1.**

#### Transcription/analysis No. 1

Transcribe and analyze [this excerpt from a classical keyboard piece](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cdmVjVjdDQ2t3djA) (must be logged into Google Drive with CU credentials to access audio). Be sure to include all of the following in your transcription/analysis (these will count towards the Aural Skills 3 grade):

- **Score:** A piano staff (treble and bass) with proper key signature, time signature, and accurate notes and rhythms (you can omit trills, mordents, turns, grace notes, and the like)   
- **Harmony:** Roman numerals and figured bass below the staff.  
- **Functions/cadences:** Harmonic functions (T/PD/D) and cadences below the Roman numerals. *There should be one T–(PD)–D–(T) progression per cadence.*  

Along with your score, submit a timeline analysis that includes the following (these will count towards the Theory 3 grade):  

- Subphrases (bi, ci)  
- Phrases (ant, cons, pres, cont, cbi)  
- Theme type (two layers if a compound theme, as noted in *Open Music Theory*)  
- Though not required, it may be helpful to reproduce the cadences on the timeline.

I have made a [video demo](https://vimeo.com/119572881) of my classical transcription process (string quartets, but still mostly applicable).

Notate the transcription in notation software (such as MuseScore, NoteFlight, Finale, Sibelius, StaffPad, or Lilypond). Submit your transcription as two files: the original music notation file and a PDF score (in case we cannot open your original file). Upload these files to the [*Aural Skills 3* D2L site](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/120555) (under "Content" then "Week 11").

Each of the bullet points listed above will be assessed on a three-point scale (same as pop/rock transcriptions). The "aural" and "theory" parts of the assignment each have three categories, total of 9 points each.
