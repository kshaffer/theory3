Choose one of the following four songs to analyze:

- The Killers, "Mr. Brightside"  
- Death Cab for Cutie, "Soul Meets Body"  
- The Shins, "Simple Song"  
- The Distillers, "I Am A Revenant"

(You may also choose a song yourself, but *only if it is approved by Kris by Wednesday, October 14*.)

The goal for this project is to be able to take a song of moderate formal complexity, come to an interpretation of the complex elements, and communicate that interpretation clearly with specific musical details to support it. Thus, all of the songs listed above have elements in their large-scale form that make it difficult to categorize a strophic, AABA, or verse-chorus, or have ambiguous elements that could be interpreted in more than one way. If you want to analyze a different song, make sure that it also has those features.

**Project overview:** Create a timeline of the form of your song, and write a short (300–1000 words) explanation of the reasoning behind your interpretation of the difficult or ambiguous elements of the song's form.

***There is no collaboration for this assignment.***

***Project is due at 8am on Monday, October 19.***

## Assignment details

Audio files for all four songs will soon be in the [class shared folder on Google Drive.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6canlCVm9WN0FnQVk) (Please download to your device before listening. If too many people access the files repeatedly in the shared folder, Google will lock it down and prohibit access.)

For each song, construct a timeline analysis of the song’s form using [Variations Audio Timeliner](http://variations.sourceforge.net/vat/) or on a paper timeline (here are [blank timelines](http://courses.shaffermusic.com/materials/timeline-blank.pdf) to print and annotate). You will find model timelines — both using VAT and paper/pencil — [in our shared folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cck1obmFTOEZGR3M). [This video](http://openmusictheory.com/VAT.html) provides instructions on using Variations Audio Timeliner. 

On your timeline, delineate all phrases, modules, and cycles, and label them appropriately (following the conventions explained in [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm-notation) and demonstrated in the example timelines). Your timelines will be assessed with the following five goals in mind:

- Correct start/end times for phrases.  
- Relationships between phrases are clearly shown (*a b a' c* etc.).  
- Correct start/end times for modules (intro, outro, strophe).  
- Relationships between modules are clearly shown (*I A1 A2 A<sub>i</sub>* etc.).  
- Correct cycle analysis.  
- Correct analytical nomenclature (capital letters, lower-case letters, primes, numbers, etc.).

Your timeline will receive up to two points for each of these six goals (total of 12 points for the timeline):

- 2 points: general accuracy (for cycle analysis, is must be completely correct; for other parameters, a few small mistakes are okay).  
- 1 point: a complete, honest attempt made, but more than a few small mistakes.  
- 0 points: not attempted, or not complete.

Then write a short essay that an educated non-musician could read, identifying the aspects of the song's formal structure that deviate from the norm or which exhibit some ambiguity, and explain the specific musical details that support your interpretations of those difficult elements. Please do not provide a play-by-play of the timeline — the timeline already does that. Instead, simply explain the reasoning behind your interpretation of the more complex moments in the song. (See the example below.)

The essay will be assessed in light of the following goals:

- 3 points: Identifies ambiguous or complex elements in the music.  
- 3 points: Offers sufficient detailed explanation for the interpretation.  
- 2 points: Communicates clearly (which includes correct grammar, etc.) for an educated, non-expert audience. (This is *not* an "academic" paper.)

The written portion is worth up to 8 points, for a total of 20 points for this project.

## Example project

I wrote an approximately [1000-word blog post (with timeline) as an example.](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2015/10/linear-narrative-cyclical-song/) You don't need to do as much textual interpretation as I did, you can simply focus on the form (the latter half of my blog post). However, if you find that as you work through your song there seems to be a good explanation for the formal ambiguity in the meaning of its text, feel free to go for it!

## Submitting timelines

**For Variations Audio Timeliner files:** Save each timeline with the file name "LASTNAME - Song title".

**For paper timelines:** scan or take a picture of each page of your timeline. If you can, combine those images into a single PDF file for each song, and name the file "LASTNAME - Song title". If you cannot combine them easily, simply name each picture file "LASTNAME - Song title - p1" (or "p2", "p3", etc.). 

**Submit the written portion of your project as a PDF file** (so we don't have to worry about compatibility with word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages).

**For both digital and paper timelines:** Upload all of your timeline files (do *not* upload the audio) to the D2L Dropbox for this assignment. Go to [our Theory 3 D2L site](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/120565), then "Content," then "Week 9," then "Pop/rock analysis project". There you will be able to upload the files.

Have fun!
