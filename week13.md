## Assignments

### For Monday, November 16, 8am

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Nov 16 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 13):

- [Sonata form: exposition types](http://openmusictheory.com/SonataTheory-exposition.html) (stop at "Multiple MCs")  
- [Structural Points of Arrival](http://openmusictheory.com/sonataStructuralPointsOfArrival.html)  
- [Thematic modules](http://openmusictheory.com/sonataThematicModules.html)  


#### Transcription/analysis No. 3

Transcribe and analyze [this excerpt of a classical keyboard piece](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cUXdjQnNwXzd2VVk) (must be logged into Google Drive with CU credentials to access audio). Be sure to include all of the following in your transcription/analysis (these will count towards the Aural Skills 3 grade):

- **Score:** A piano staff (treble and bass) with proper key signature, time signature, and accurate notes and rhythms (you can omit trills, mordents, turns, grace notes, and the like)   
- **Harmony:** Roman numerals and figured bass below the staff.  
- **Functions/cadences:** Harmonic functions (T/PD/D) and cadences below the Roman numerals. *There should be one T–(PD)–D–(T) progression per cadence.*  

Along with your score, submit a timeline analysis that includes the following (these will count towards the Theory 3 grade):  

- Subphrases (bi, ci)  
- Phrases (ant, cons, pres, cont, cbi)  
- Theme type (two layers if a compound theme, as noted in *Open Music Theory*)  
- Though not required, it may be helpful to reproduce the cadences on the timeline.

I have made a [video demo](https://vimeo.com/119572881) of my classical transcription process (string quartets, but still mostly applicable).

Notate the transcription in notation software (such as MuseScore, NoteFlight, Finale, Sibelius, StaffPad, or Lilypond). Submit your transcription as two files: the original music notation file and a PDF score (in case we cannot open your original file). Upload these files to the [*Aural Skills 3* D2L site](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/120555) (under "Content" then "Week 12").

Each of the bullet points listed above will be assessed on a three-point scale (same as pop/rock transcriptions). The "aural" and "theory" parts of the assignment each have three categories, total of 9 points each.


### For Wednesday, November 18, 8am

#### Reading quiz

Read the following, and then take the Nov 18 reading quiz in the Theory 3 D2L site (under Content >> Week 13):

- [Sonata form: the recapitulation](http://openmusictheory.com/sonataRecap.html)


### For Thursday, November 19, 8am

Make ***two*** conceptual videos. Each video should be no more than 90 seconds long, and should explain one of the core concepts from Week 10 (listed above). See the [Assessment Guide](/assessments/) for details about creating these videos, including examples, before you begin. Remember to include a musical example that was *not covered in class or in the assigned readings.* Submit the videos to the D2L theory site (under "Content" then "Week 13").
