Wednesday's class will begin with a closed-note, ungraded "quiz." The purpose is to help you memorize some important basic concepts, and to have them fresh in your mind (what psychologists call "primed" in memory) as we begin class. This will hopefully allow for deeper class discussion and engagement with what we work on in class. The "quiz" will draw from the following reflection questions. Find and memorize the answers to these questions in Wednesday's readings.

1. Define *praxis*.  

> The union of theory and practice.

2. Define *syncopation*.  

> Syncopation occurs when a rhythmic pattern that typically occurs on strong beats or strong parts of the beat occurs instead on weak beats or weak parts of the beat. (OMT – Syncopation in pop/rock music)

3. Define *truncated onbeat note*.  

> The first of "two quick notes back-to-back...one short note on the beat followed by the first of the longer syncopated notes" sometimes used to begin a syncopated passage.

4. How do Brown, Roedinger, and McDaniel define *learning*?  

> "acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities."

5. "Learning is deeper and more duarble when it's _____."  

> effortful

6. Which leads to faster learning gains? — massed practice or varied & interleaved practice.  

> massed practice

7. Which leads to longer-lasting learning gains? — massed practice or varied & interleaved practice.  

> varied & interleaved practice

8. Why can a clear explanatory lecture hinder learning?  

> "the ease with which they follow the argument gives them the feeling that they already know it and don't need to study it." IOW, clarity leads to less mental effort, which leads to less understanding and long-lasting memories.

9. What interrupts forgetting?  

> recall

10. Rereading a text is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  

> false

11. Repeated practice of the same kind of thing is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  

> false

12. Practice sessions of the same kind of thing spaced out in time is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  

> true

13. Varying practice among different kinds of things is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  

> true

14. Attempting to solve a problem before being taught how to solve it is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  

> true

15. Getting it right every time leads to better learning than making mistakes and correcting them. *true/false*  

> false
