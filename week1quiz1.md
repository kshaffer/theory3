Wednesday's class will begin with a closed-note, ungraded "quiz." The purpose is to help you memorize some important basic concepts, and to have them fresh in your mind (what psychologists call "primed" in memory) as we begin class. This will hopefully allow for deeper class discussion and engagement with what we work on in class. The "quiz" will draw from the following reflection questions. Find and memorize the answers to these questions in Wednesday's readings.

1. Define *praxis*.  
2. Define *syncopation*.  
3. Define *truncated onbeat note*.  
4. How do Brown, Roedinger, and McDaniel define *learning*?  
5. "Learning is deeper and more duarble when it's _____."  
6. Which leads to faster learning gains? — massed practice or varied & interleaved practice.  
7. Which leads to longer-lasting learning gains? — massed practice or varied & interleaved practice.  
8. Why can a clear explanatory lecture hinder learning?  
9. What interrupts forgetting?  
10. Rereading a text is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  
11. Repeated practice of the same kind of thing is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  
12. Practice sessions of the same kind of thing spaced out in time is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  
13. Varying practice among different kinds of things is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  
14. Attempting to solve a problem before being taught how to solve it is a productive study/learning technique. *true/false*  
15. Getting it right every time leads to better learning than making mistakes and correcting them. *true/false*
