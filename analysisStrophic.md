Create timeline analyses of the following two strophic songs:

- "Let It Be," by The Beatles  
- "California Dreamin'," by The Mamas and the Papas

These timelines are due on **Monday, September 21, at 8am.** The count for the Theory 3 grade, and they should be submitted to the Theory 3 D2L site (see below).

## Assignment details

Audio files for both songs are in the [class shared folder on Google Drive.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cQ005T1ljSzB3M3c) (Please download to your device before listening. If too many people access the files repeatedly in the shared folder, Google will lock it down and prohibit access.)

For each song, construct a timeline analysis of the song’s form using [Variations Audio Timeliner](http://variations.sourceforge.net/vat/) or on a paper timeline (here are [blank timelines](http://courses.shaffermusic.com/materials/timeline-blank.pdf) to print and annotate). You will find model timelines — both using VAT and paper/pencil — [in our shared folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9o4hmKNoi6cck1obmFTOEZGR3M). [This video](http://openmusictheory.com/VAT.html) provides instructions on using Variations Audio Timeliner. 

On your timeline, delineate all phrases and modules, and label them appropriately (following the conventions explained in [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com/popRockForm-notation) and demonstrated in the example timelines). Your timelines will be assessed with the following five goals in mind:

- Correct start/end times for phrases.  
- Relationships between phrases are clearly shown (*a b a' c* etc.).  
- Correct start/end times for modules (intro, outro, strophe).  
- Relationships between modules are clearly shown (*I A1 A2 A<sub>i</sub>* etc.).  
- Correct analytical nomenclature (capital letters, lower-case letters, primes, numbers, etc.).

Each song will receive up to two points for each of these five goals:

- 2 points: general accuracy (a few small mistakes).  
- 1 point: a complete, honest attempt made, but more than a few small mistakes.  
- 0 points: not attempted, or not complete.

Each song can receive up to 10 points, for a total of 20 points for the assignment.

## Submitting timelines

**For Variations Audio Timeliner files:** Save each timeline with the file name "LASTNAME - Song title".

**For paper timelines:** scan or take a picture of each page of your timeline. If you can, combine those images into a single PDF file for each song, and name the file "LASTNAME - Song title". If you cannot combine them easily, simply name each picture file "LASTNAME - Song title - p1" (or "p2", "p3", etc.). 

**For both digital and paper timelines:** Upload all of your timeline files (do *not* upload the audio) to the D2L Dropbox for this assignment. Go to [our Theory 3 D2L site](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/120565), then "Content," then "Week 5," then "Strophic song analysis (Sep 21)". There you will be able to upload the files.

Have fun!
