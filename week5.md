## Assignments

**For Wednesday, September 23, beginning of class,** watch the strophic song analysis follow-up video. Compare the analyses in the video to the ones you submitted for Monday, and bring any questions you have have about them to class on Wednesday.

**For Thursday, September 24, 8am,** make ***two*** conceptual videos. Each video should be no more than 90 seconds long, and should explain one of the core concepts from Week 5 (listed above). See the [Assessment Guide](/assessments/) for details about creating these videos, including examples, before you begin. Submit the videos to the D2L theory site (under "Content" then "Week 5").

**For Thursday, September 24, 8am,** if you did not pass both of the conceptual videos you submitted for Week 4, you can reassess one or both of them in the reassessments dropbox in D2L.

***For Monday, September 28, 8am,*** transcribe [Song TBA]() by TBA (must be logged into Google Drive with CU credentials to access audio). Be sure to include all of the following in your transcription:

- Proper key signature  
- Proper time signature  
- All vocal parts (lead and background)  
- All instrumental parts (guitar, bass, etc.)  
- Do *not* transcribe any full-chord guitar, synth, or piano parts. (The harmonic labels will account for that.)  
- Lead-sheet symbols above the melody.  
- Roman numerals below the bass. (Be sure to reflect any modal mixture or applied chords appropriately.)

Notate the transcription in notation software (such as MuseScore, NoteFlight, Finale, Sibelius, StaffPad, or Lilypond). Submit your transcription as two files: the original music notation file and a PDF score (in case we cannot open your original file). Upload these files to the [Aural Skills 3 D2L site](https://learn.colorado.edu/d2l/home/120555) (under "Content" then "Week 6").

For grading information on this assignment, see the [Assessments Guide](/assessments/).
