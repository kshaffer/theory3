We will be using Google Drive as our mode of submitting assignments online and receiving feedback and grades. Following are general instructions for online submissions. Be sure to note any assignment-specific instructions provided in the weekly schedules.

# Video instructions

The following video walks you through the process in detail. This is probably the best way to make sure you're doing it correctly. Please watch it and follow the instructions precisely, especially for the first few assignments as you get the hang of the procedure. (Barring unforeseen circumstances, we will use the same procedure *all year long* for theory and aural skills.)

# Abbreviated written instructions

## Setting up your shared folder

*You only have to do this part once at the beginning of the semester.*

Create a folder in your CU Google Drive account. Share that folder (with *editing* privileges) with all of the theory & aural skills instructors and TAs (we share grading duties): kris.shaffer@colorado.edu, elena.specht@colorado.edu, mark.arnett@colorado.edu, and ida.findiku@colorado.edu.

Once you do this, the instructors/graders will be able to access any of the files or folders that you place in this shared folder throughout the semester.

## Submitting an assignment

For each assignment, create a new folder for the assignment in Google Drive, inside your main submissions folder. Name it something like "Lastname - Assignment Title" (For example, **Shaffer – Transcription 1**). Insert any files you are submitting into that folder (videos, audio clips, scores, timelines, essays, etc.).

Finally, get the sharing link for that folder (right-click on the folder and select "Get Link"), copy that link, and paste it into the form provided on the assignment schedule. *Your assignment is not submitted until this link is entered into the form.*

## Getting help

If you have any issues or difficulty, please [email me](mailto:kris.shaffer@colorado.edu) in advance of the deadline to still receive credit (earlier if you would like help before submitting).
